**Overview**
Today, we are going to get a very basic introduction to the qualitative research software package, Nvivo.

-How to upload data files
-How to perform basic coding
We aren’t planning to do any hands-on playtime today, but I am going to provide follow-up information for you to use.  

**What is NVivo**
NVivo is a data analysis software that supports qualitative and mixed methods research. It helps organize, analyze, and find insights in unstructured data.
 
**What does this mean?**
There are various strategies for qualitative and mixed methods research. For some examples, check out Sage Research Methods, a database you can access through the Libraries which has research guides and models for you to use as you learn to do these kinds of research. We have put a selection of materials together to help with a variety of potential qualitative research methods in our participants folder for your convenience!
 
NVivo is a platform that facilitates your research by helping to execute coding and queries. Through NVivo, you as the researcher can identify, categories, annotate, and assign attributes to your data in a way that allows you to sift and view subsets of your data. In other words, NVivo is a piece of software that helps you sort your data into subsets for better analysis.

**Preparing your data for coding and analysis**
As Sara mentioned, NVivo is a tool that helps you code and run queries in order to find insights in unstructured data.
“Qualitative coding is the process by which segments of data are identified as relating to, or being an example of, a more general idea, instance, theme or category... Whether coding manually or using software, you will build up a system to organize data and your ideas about it. Coding therefore manages and orders qualitative data.”

NVivo will help you organize your data as well as your ideas about your data.

It can be helpful to brainstorm your ideas, expectations, or initial assumptions before beginning your coding in NVivo. One way to brainstorm is by creating a mind-map. Having this information before coding can provide you with some insight into your coding as well as the hierarchy of your coding. It’s been my experience that part of the coding process includes updating and reorganizing your coding the further you get into your project, so this process of brainstorming may take place throughout your project.
