<h1>Introduction to WordPress Part 1: Creating a site on WordPress.com</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
Wordpress, an open access web publishing platform that is very popular within the DH community. We will talk about the difference between the Wordpress installations on the ADHC server and the cloud-based free accounts on Wordpress.com, navigating the dashboard, creating content, choosing a template, adding users, and importing or embedding media.

<p>WordPress is a free open source platform for web publishing and a support community of content creators and developers who work within the WordPress environment.</p>

<p>Because WordPress is an application, a platform, a service, and a community, there are a few different ways we can access WordPress. Basically, it means that at its core, WordPress is a computer application that allows us to build websites. These websites can live on the WordPress server or almost any other server in the world. Wordpress is free to use. There are a few ways that we can build sites in WordPress:
<ul>
  <li>WordPress.Org is a site that supports web designers and developers who can download and install WordPress on their own servers. </li>
  <li>Users like you and I can build a site using WordPress.com by creating an account and just starting to build, with no ‘back end’ skill or knowledge necessary.</li>
</ul>
  
<h2>Let’s Create an Account</h2>
  
The ADHC hosts instances of WordPress on our servers for Digital Humanities Projects, but for today’s purpose we are all going to just make a sandbox site at <a href:"http://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a>

<h3><a href:"http://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a></h3>
<ol>
  <li>Create an account. Use the email account of your choice-- it is not necessary to use your UA email unless you choose. It just needs to be an email address that you have easy access to during this workshop.</li>
  <li>Follow the directions to verify your account and take measures to remember your password.</li>
  <li>In the future, you can go to https://wordpress.com/log-in/ and use your email and password to access your WordPress site! If you forget how to get to the login page, you can type “wordpress.com login” into your browser and you will be able to navigate there pretty easily.</li>
</ol>

<h2>I have an account, now what?</h2>
<h3>Name Your Site</h3>

<h3>Choose a Theme</h3>

<h3>Create a Page</h3>

<h3>Create a Post</h3>

<h3>Add an Image</h3>

<h3>Create a Navigation Menu</h3>

Let’s talk about what you want your site to be about. Today, we are making sandbox sites. That means we can make them about anything we want. We can make sure they’re hidden so that we can be free to play with our sites as much as we want and try new features and designs without worrying about someone coming across it randomly on the Internet.

There are just a few more things you need to do before you start to build your site. 
Who is your audience? Make sure you write for the audience you intend to target for your site. Next week’s Lunch & Learn is focused specifically on this topic, so don’t miss it!
